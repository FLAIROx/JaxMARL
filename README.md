## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in JAX

JaxMARL combines ease-of-use with GPU-enabled efficiency, and supports a wide range of commonly used MARL environments as well as popular baseline algorithms. Our aim is for one library that enables thorough evaluation of MARL methods across a wide range of tasks and against relevant baselines. We also introduce SMAX, a vectorised, simplified version of the popular StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, which removes the need to run the StarCraft II game engine. 

For more details, take a look at our [blog post](https://blog.foersterlab.com/jaxmarl/) or our [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/FLAIROx/JaxMARL/blob/main/jaxmarl/tutorials/JaxMARL_Walkthrough.ipynb), which walks through the basic usage.

<h2 name="algorithms" id="algorithms">Baseline Algorithms ü¶â </h2>

We follow CleanRL's philosophy of providing single file implementations which can be found within the `baselines` directory. We use Hydra to manage our config files, with specifics explained in each algorithm's README. Most files include `wandb` logging code, this is disabled by default but can be enabled within the file's config.

<h2 name="install" id="install">Installation üßó </h2>

**Environments** - Before installing, ensure you have the correct [JAX version](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) for your hardware accelerator. The JaxMARL environments can be installed directly from PyPi:

```
pip install jaxmarl 
```

**Algorithms** - If you would like to also run the algorithms, install the source code as follows:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/FLAIROx/JaxMARL.git && cd JaxMARL
    ```
2. The requirements for IPPO & MAPPO can be installed with:
    ``` 
    pip install -e .
    export PYTHONPATH=./JaxMARL:$PYTHONPATH
    ```

<h2 name="start" id="start">Quick Start üöÄ </h2>

We take inspiration from the [PettingZoo](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo) and [Gymnax](https://github.com/RobertTLange/gymnax) interfaces. You can try out training an agent in our [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/FLAIROx/JaxMARL/blob/main/jaxmarl/tutorials/JaxMARL_Walkthrough.ipynb). Further introduction scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/FLAIROx/JaxMARL/tree/main/jaxmarl/tutorials).

### Basic JaxMARL API  Usage üñ•Ô∏è

Actions, observations, rewards and done values are passed as dictionaries keyed by agent name, allowing for differing action and observation spaces. The done dictionary contains an additional `"__all__"` key, specifying whether the episode has ended. We follow a parallel structure, with each agent passing an action at each timestep. For asynchronous games, such as Hanabi, a dummy action is passed for agents not acting at a given timestep.

```python 
import jax
from jaxmarl import make

key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
key, key_reset, key_act, key_step = jax.random.split(key, 4)

# Initialise environment.
env = make('MPE_simple_world_comm_v3')

# Reset the environment.
obs, state = env.reset(key_reset)

# Sample random actions.
key_act = jax.random.split(key_act, env.num_agents)
actions = {agent: env.action_space(agent).sample(key_act[i]) for i, agent in enumerate(env.agents)}

# Perform the step transition.
obs, state, reward, done, infos = env.step(key_step, state, actions)
```

### Dockerfile üêã
To help get experiments up and running we include a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/FLAIROx/JaxMARL/blob/main/Dockerfile) and its corresponding [Makefile](https://github.com/FLAIROx/JaxMARL/blob/main/Makefile). With Docker and the [Nvidia Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/index.html) installed, the container can be built with:
```
make build
```
The built container can then be run:
```
make run
```
